Gomerger is a command line tool that allows you to compose one images using more images located in a folder.

Given a source folder containing the images, the program resizes all the images
at the same dimension (default is 120x90) and calculates the disposition of the images in a rectangle.
If the number of the images is a prime number, and one of the image can not fit into a rectangle, the tool will skip one images, until the total number of the images will fit into a  rectangle.

Simply run 'gomerger' in the folder containing your images. If you run 'gomerger -h' the default options will be displayed

	Usage of gomerger:
	  -dest_dir=".": the destination directory that will contain the grid
	  -log_file="stdout": specify a log file, as default it will print on stdout
	  -source_dir=".": the origin directory that contains the images to compose the grid
	  -thumb_height=90: the height of a single thumb
	  -thumb_width=120: the width of a single thumb

To specify a different source directory as the current direcotry, a different destination directory as the current one, and a logfile, do as follow.

	gomerger dest_dir=/home/username/dest source_dir=/home/username/source log_file=/home/username/my.log
